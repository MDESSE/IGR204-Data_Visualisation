### A description of the problem

#### Who are the users :

> Anyone interested in movies,  

#### What are their backgrounds:

> No specific background : Can range from the teenager to the Journalist, Content writers for websites or blogs related to movies. 

#### What are they trying to understand from the Data

>what makes a movie a blockbuster, and what makes a blockbuster a milestone of a generation. 
>
>How much money is involved for a BB
>
>How Blockbusters and Actors are related

#### Is your visualization aimed primarly at exploring or communicating the data?

> I would say Communicative rather than explorative ?



### Questions we can explore :

#### Financial Data:  

- Evolution of most profitable movies 

- investment vs profit ( do you need to invest a lot to get a BB?)

  

#### Geographical Data: 

- Where are blockbusters produced (localisation of the studio)

- Most powerful studios?

- Which studios produce the most of blockbuster?

- Where are scenes of blockbusters filmed ? (check if data set available)

  

#### Actors Data: 

- Are famous actors required to produce a block buster?

- How many actors became famous with a blockB

- Are some actors only known for playing BB?

- who earn the most ? https://minimaxir.com/2016/04/movie-gender/

  

### Consumers:

- Are blockbusters the best rated movies?  (IMDB, rottentomato ratings)
- How those movies influenced the pop culture (check if data available)





### Where does that idea come from :

- We wanted to work on movies but it was a scope way too broad. We then looked for movies with Oscars, but some movies don't have enough information of them(independent studios/ producers). After digging deeper we ended with 'BlockBuster' movies . 
- Advantages : smaller number of movies, producers, categories , actors, studio,  highly documented movies



### Datasets for that project :

### Some works to get inspirations from :

### Other suggestions  :

- Reduce the scope to :'**horror movies?**  : how many involve : monster/ puppet/ based on real stories // etc ... 

- **Superheroes** ? We can mix it with movies too.
