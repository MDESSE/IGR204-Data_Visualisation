# **IGR 204 - Data Visualisation** 

## **Milestone 1 : project description**



**Project members :** Axel CAMARA, Fran√ßois CULIERE, Matthieu DESSE, Vincent RICHARD and Hiroto YAMAKAWA.

**Topic :** What is the map of higher education in France ? Which areas are the most attractiv ?  What could we say it exists some discrimination to access some specific studies ?

**Datasets (source, format) :** 

**Objectives :**

- **Who are the users ?** 
  - We could imagine talk to lawmakers and propose a description of french higher education. The purpose could be some improvement axis.
- **What are their backgrounds ?**
  - Most of lawmakers are politics professionals. It is very important to have an exhaustive and various view of this statement. 
- **What are they trying to understand from the data ?**
  - At first, we want to answer to the questions above (description, attractivity, discrimination). From these observations, we will build an action plan to reduce inequalities.
- **Is your visualisation aimed primarily at *exploring* or *communicating* the data?**
  - Despite an important phase of data mining, we are convinced that the french system create inequalities between areas (system centred on the capital). The main objectives will be communicate about these disparities.


- **Data description :** What are the characteristics of the data, the attributes, the size of the dataset, etc.

- Our reference dataset is composed by the list of all french institution, localisation, gender mix, years...
- One of our objectives is to complete this dataset with others sources for instance :
  - geographic origin of students (*parcourssup.fr*)
  - budget for each fields (*insee.fr*)
  - more demographic data
