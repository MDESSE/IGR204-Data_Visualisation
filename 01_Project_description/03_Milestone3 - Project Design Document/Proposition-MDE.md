#  Design document - MDE Proposition



## 1. Select a design requirement

Through this visualisation, we want to explore and understand what are the main characteristics of a successful movie. To answer to this question, I propose a visualisation with a funnel approach : begin from an overview to a focused view of a specific characteristic. The second objective will be to propose alternative views thanks to interactivity. Indeed, once main characteristics identified, we will developt tools to navigate among its.



## 2. Sketch our idea

I have imagined a simple web page as an infography that we can scroll. We have four parts :

- Overview : explore main characteristics
- Approach explanation with our custom metrics (financial, popularaty, both, ...)
- Geographical view
- Custom view : e.g. actresses/actors bankable or attractive

2 important ideas :

- The funnel approach
- and the personalised experience through the interactive tools.

These two previous points imply that we adopt more  an explanatory visualisation than exploration view.
