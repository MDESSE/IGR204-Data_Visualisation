# <center> How to Make a Successful Movie

**Group Q  : Axel CAMARA, François CULIERE, Matthieu DESSE, Vincent RICHARD and Hiroto YAMAKAWA**

At first, it is essential to define what is a successful movie. 

**Several intuition axis :** box-office admission, incomes, difference between incomes and production budget, ratings on specific websites (*imdb*, *allociné*), does a blockbuster is a successful movie (high budget, low to high incomes) ?

#### A description of the problem

##### Who are the users :

> Producers, investors and more generally cinema professionals $\rightarrow$  business and artistic points of view
>
> Journalists or Cine-lovers  $\rightarrow$ artistic point of view
>

##### What are their backgrounds:

> Business people interested in the financial metrics,
>
> Artistic people or consumers more interested with the ratings and others insights (awards)

##### What are they trying to understand from the Data

>What makes a successful movie ? What makes a movie a milestone of a generation. 
>
>How much money is involved for it ? How could influence producers to support independent movie ?
>

##### Is your visualisation aimed primarily at exploring or communicating the data?

> I would say communicative rather than exploration way. Therefore, after an important data-mining phase, we will build our visualisation to answer questions above and others else ! 

#### Questions we can explore :

##### Financial Data:  

- Evolution of most profitable movies

- Investment vs profit ( do you need to invest a lot to get a successful movie ?)


##### Geographical Data: 

- Where are successful movie produced (localisation of the studio) ? Filming location ?

- Most powerful studios ? Which studios produce the most of successful movie ?

- Where are scenes of successful movie filmed ? (check if data set available)


##### Actors Data: 

- Are famous actors required to produce a successful movie? How many actors became famous with a successful movie

- Are some actors only known for playing successful movie? who earn the most ? https://minimaxir.com/2016/04/movie-gender/

##### Consumers:

- Are blockbusters the best rated movies  (IMDB, rottentomato ratings)  ? 

- How those movies influenced the pop culture (check if data available)


#### **Data description** :

We will begin with the dataset proposed in IGR204. But we will try to enhance it with external data as well :

- scrapped data (wikipidia, imdb, ...)
- examples of reference datasets which we will use (non exhaustive) :
