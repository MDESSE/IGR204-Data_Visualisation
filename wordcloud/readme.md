## Wordcloud

If you want to develop on this graph, you need to install npm on your computer. Then, run the following command to install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### Updating the code

You can modify the wordcloud.js file to add updates. When the work is done, run the following command before starting the server:

browserify wordcloud.js -o bundle.js
```

If you don't have access to browserify, you may need to install it in global:

```sh
sudo npm install -g browserify
```
